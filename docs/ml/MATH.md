# Co-Variance:
Covariance is a measures the extent two features either increase or decrease with each other (range ( − ∞ , ∞ ) ). A covariance score of 0 indicates that both features are not related. If the covariance score is positive it means that both features increase in the same direction and a negative score indicates an inverse relationship between the two features. 

A Covariance matrix is used in PCA, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis Distance. 

# Correlation
Correlation lets us know the strength and direction of the two features (range ( − 1 , 1 ) ). If we say two features are correlated, then we can say that a change in one feature creates an impact/change in another variable. A positive correlation indicates that as one feature increases the other will increase, a correlation score of 0 indicates no relationship between variables and a negative correlation indicates that as one feature increases the other will 
decrease. 

Correlation is just in large amounts of data is to find patterns, e.g. correlated features within a dataset.
