# Case Study

- When a user adds an item to their cart, we need to calculate the probability that they will return the product (given that they complete the order). Using this probability, the company can adjust shipping charges accordingly. For example, if the probability of return is high, the company may increase shipping charges to discourage potential returns. How would you calculate this probability?

- Can you explain what A/B Testing is? How would you take a uniform sample set of 10M users from streaming data of approximately 10B users, ensuring that every user has equal probability of being in the final sampled set?

- In a scenario where you have a small sample size of approximately 20 observations, which statistical test would you use and why?
    - This tests understanding of:
        - Small sample size statistics
        - When to use parametric vs non-parametric tests
        - Knowledge of t-test vs z-test vs other tests

- In a credit card fraud detection system, how would you determine the optimal classification threshold? While ROC-AUC is one metric, what other considerations and metrics should be taken into account given that:

    - False positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) cause customer inconvenience
    - False negatives (missed fraud) cause direct financial loss

- You need to design a recommendation system to replace an existing rule-based job search system. Provide a detailed plan
