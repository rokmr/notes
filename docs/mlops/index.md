# MLOps

**MLOps** combines Machine Learning with DevOps best practices to automate and manage the entire ML lifecycle. It helps in delivering reliable, scalable, and maintainable ML systems.

## ML Lifecycle Stages in MLOps

**Data Collection & Preparation**

   - Gather and clean raw data.
   - Data versioning and feature engineering.

**Model Training**

   - Experimentation and tuning of models.
   - Track experiments and hyperparameters.

**Model Validation & Testing**

   - Evaluate accuracy, fairness, and robustness.
   - Validate on new/unseen data.

**Model Deployment**

   - Deploy model to production environment.
   - Use APIs, microservices, or edge devices.

**Monitoring & Maintenance**

   - Monitor model performance and data drift.
   - Trigger retraining or rollback when needed.

## Types of ML Development

### Batch Processing
- Process large datasets at scheduled intervals.
- Used for offline training and periodic updates.
- Examples: nightly retraining, report generation.

### Stream Processing
- Continuous, near real-time data ingestion and processing.
- Enables live analytics and alerting.
- Examples: fraud detection, user behavior tracking.

### Real-time Inference
- Low latency predictions (<100ms).
- Used for instant decisions like ad bidding, image recognition.

### Edge Deployment
- Model runs locally on devices like mobiles, drones, IoT.
- Benefits: offline use, privacy, reduced latency.

## CI/CD 

- Automate data ingestion, model training, testing, and deployment.
- Integrate version control for:
  - Code
  - Data sets
  - Models
- Automate testing for data quality, model accuracy, and bias.
- Enable rollback or redeployment on model degradation or errors.
- Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI.

## Monitoring & Governance

**Model Monitoring**

- Track accuracy, latency, and detect drift; alert on anomalies.

**Data Governance**

- Manage data lineage and ensure regulatory compliance.

**Model Governance**

- Control model versions with access management and audits.
