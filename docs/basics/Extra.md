## Handling Data Imbalance

- **over-sampling:** sample the minority class significantly more such that the dataset is more balanced 
- **under-sampling:** sample the majority class significantly less such that the dataset is more balanced 
- **SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique)** creates examples of the minority class by randomly sampling feature values from the current features 
- **Use another ML model:** tree-based models perform well on imbalanced datasets
