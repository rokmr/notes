## Calculus Basics

### Derivatives

The derivative of a function represents its rate of change. For a function $f(x)$, we write the derivative as $f'(x)$ or $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$.

Some basic derivatives:

1. $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$
2. $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$
3. $\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}$

### Integrals

The integral is the inverse operation of differentiation. The indefinite integral is written as:

$$
\int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C
$$

Where $F'(x) = f(x)$ and $C$ is the constant of integration.

## Example Problems

### Problem 1

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^2\sin(x)$

**Solution:**

Using the product rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 2x\sin(x) + x^2\cos(x) \\
&= x(2\sin(x) + x\cos(x))
\end{align*}
$$
